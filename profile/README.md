# Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab (CIOL)

---

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** play a crucial role in Industrial and Production Engineering, particularly in optimizing processes, enhancing efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance, and more. Our curriculum lacks sufficient emphasis on AI/ML, which is vital to address this gap and ensure that students acquire the necessary skills to meet both industry and academic demands, contributing to the growth of the country.

**Computational Intelligence and Operations Lab (CIOL)** is founded by [**MD Shafiqul Islam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-shafikul-islam-sohan/) and [**Azmine Toushik Wasi**](https://azminewasi.github.io/) to accelerate **IPE-AI combinational research** at SUST-IPE, filling up the current gap of ML-focused research in the department. It is a virtual research facility focusing on the development and application of advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computational techniques for solving complex problems in various domains such as manufacturing, operations research, supply chain management, logistics, and transportation. The lab's research aims to push the boundaries of AI, ML, optimization, and data analytics to create innovative solutions addressing real-world challenges faced by businesses and society.

With a team of highly dedicated researchers and youngsters, CIOL is committed to advancing the field of computational intelligence and developing tools and technologies that enable smarter decision-making and more efficient operations using a combination of OR, ML, and AI.
